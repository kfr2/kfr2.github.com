### My goals
One of my goals is to create beautiful software that assists users in living a better life.  Applications without a focus distract users from completing their tasks efficiently and hinder their ability to live a life in the real world.  Although I have interests in many areas of computer science, programming, and development (as well as in life itself), my current interests focus on creating responsive and intelligent applications with an intention of simplifying (rather than increasing) the amount of work a person has to complete to get things done.  Computers are very good at repeating boring or complicated tasks, so we should harness that power to make lives better.

Currently, I work predominantly with the [Django web framework](http://djangoproject.com) and the [Python](http://www.python.org/) programming language but have experience with a variety of languages and frameworks.  Indeed, I greatly enjoy learning new development tools and paradigms as, ultimately, I want to create wonderful experiences for users and will learn whichever languages or tools are neccessary.  Moreover, I am very interested in data science and analytics.  To this end, I am examining how I can use tools like [R](http://cran.r-project.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) to better understand life.
