        <h2 class="page-title">Items of the Week: March 11, 2013</h2>
        <p>I've decided to start creating a weekly post describing the websites or other items I've found interesting over the past week. Although the majority of items will likely be websites (as they are often the most easily accessible kind of items), I may mention books, applications, video games, or anything else.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.trello.com/trello-for-ipad-is-here/">Trello for iPad is Here!</a> -- The incredibly useful board- and list-based information management tool now has an iPad application. It looks fantastic but has a few oddities on iPad mini (such as a card's edit description field appearing below the on-screen keyboard).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/2012/08/trello-again-followup/">Trello Again:  Followup</a> -- An examination of <a href="http://davidseah.com/">David Seah</a>'s personal Trello workflow. He seems to advocate keeping all personal items on one board so as to not lose track of items spanning multiple boards. Furthermore, I enjoy his idea of prepending unplanned items with a "+" sign.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/">Thoughtbot</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/product-management/trello">Process management with Trello guide</a> -- Over the past four months, I've been trying to revamp my team's (essentially non-existent) style of project management to something resembling [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development) because we serve in an operational role and work on many projects simulataneously. Originally, we followed <a href="https://community.uservoice.com/blog/trello-google-docs-product-management/">the Trello workflow used by Uservoice</a> and found it generally worked well. However, I've felt it lacked a good place to note technical improvements/refactorings that had to be made (such as upgrading a site from Django 1.3 to 1.4) as well as a good review process. Thoughtbot's guide to its Trello workflow solves many of the issues I've had with my team's current Trello implementation and seems like it will work much better for my team's structure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-trello-tech-stack/">The Trello Tech Stack</a> -- Brett Kiefer describes the front-end and back-end technologies used to create Trello.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://omniti.com/seeds/your-code-may-be-elegant">Your Code May Be Elegant</a>
 -- "Your code may be elegant, but if it doesn't meet the objectives (be they time or business) it doesn't f***ing work." Although it is interesting and exciting to build the most robust solution possible, it is more important to consider the business contraints of time and money.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://timepiece.inostudio.de/">Timepiece Rounded</a> -- An OpenType-font which displays time strings (like 17:23:25) as a clock glyph. Fonts can define <a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-era-of-symbol-fonts">custom ligatures</a>, a sequence of characters, that are replaced with a single glyph.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html">Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM</a> -- "[â€¦] a fairly comprehensive introduction to the Clojure programming language."</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://www.one-tab.com/">OneTab</a> -- A neat Chrome extension that converts all your tabs to a list within a page (and then back again).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://mediaqueri.es">Media Queries</a> -- "A collection of inspirational websites using media queries and responsive web design." </p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="http://craphound.com/ftw/">For the Win</a> by <a href="http://craphound.com/">Cory Doctorow</a> -- A novel in which gold farmers struggle to bring better working conditions to themselves and all workers around the world. This was an incredibly fun and engaging book that will have the reader pondering the conditions of life in third world countries.</p>
