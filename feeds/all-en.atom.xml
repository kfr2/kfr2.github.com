This conference was well orchestrated and provided incredible value in both knowledge development and networking opportunities. In particular, I found the "&lt;a href="http://devopsdays.org/events/2014-pittsburgh/proposals/How%20is%20ChatOps%20Formed/"&gt;How is ChatOps formed?&lt;/a&gt;" presentation by Carol Nichols highly enlightening. The end of the first day of the conference found me setting up a HipChat group as well as a Hubot instance for my company. Everyone seems to really like these tools and it feels as though the team members are in better sync with one another.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I greatly enjoy how a variety of services can broadcast messages into HipChat rooms as it is useful to see notifications as they become available. For instance, Bitbucket posts messages whenever someone commits to our repositories and &lt;a href="https://codeship.io/"&gt;Codeship&lt;/a&gt; posts messages detailing when builds start and eventually succeed or fail. It is great fun to have Hubot pick up on the messages and respond appropriately. The following script responds with a Final Fantasy victory image whenever a build succeeds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;script src="https://gist.github.com/kfr2/35fc387dd31702d2642c.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My team's development occurs in feature or bug fix branches and must be reviewed by someone other Thadn the author before the changes are merged into stable branches. We use Bitbucket's pull requests to facilitate this process. I wanted pull request notifications to be broadcasted into our HipChat room but the &lt;a href="https://marketplace.atlassian.com/plugins/atlassian-labs-hipchat-bitbucket"&gt;HipChat Bitbucket Connector&lt;/a&gt; unfortunately doesn't seem to presently support them. Not one to be defeated, I wrote a small node.js application to &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/bitbucket-pull-request-connector"&gt;connect Bitbucket pull requests to notification services&lt;/a&gt;. Although HipChat is presently the only supported notification service, it should be trivial to connect another service like CampFire or Slack. See the repository's &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/bitbucket-pull-request-connector/blob/master/README.md"&gt;README&lt;/a&gt; for instructions on running the application on Heroku and &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/bitbucket-pull-request-connector/blob/master/connectors/hipchat.js"&gt;connectors/hipchat.js&lt;/a&gt; to formulate an idea of how you'd integrate with your preferred service.

Accordingly, this year I once again attended &lt;a href="http://steelcityruby.org/"&gt;Steel City Ruby Conf&lt;/a&gt;, a two-day, single-track conference held at the beautiful &lt;a href="http://www.heinzhistorycenter.org/"&gt;Senator John Heinz History Center&lt;/a&gt; in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. What follows are a number of my thoughts on various aspects of this great conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even though the conference is branded as a Ruby conference, I've found it focuses more on community building/maintenance and life lessons than on technical details. However, as these topics transcend languages and are very good to consider during life, I certainly did not find any fault with this approach. The topics of the talks were incredibly approachable by anyone at the conference -- even non-developers -- and are things I would assume the average developer doesn't consider during his day-to-day life. Nonetheless, I found myself wishing a few more of the talks would contain technical details. Fortunately, &lt;a href="https://github.com/jimweirich"&gt;Jim Weirich&lt;/a&gt; presented a very fascinating look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/jimweirich/argus"&gt;argus&lt;/a&gt; -- a Ruby library he wrote to control &lt;a href="http://ardrone2.parrot.com/"&gt;Parrot AR Drones&lt;/a&gt; -- and provided enough technical details to partially sate my desire. Similarly, &lt;a href="https://github.com/sdball"&gt;Stephen Ball&lt;/a&gt; provided a great explanation of how to use &lt;code&gt;git rebase&lt;/code&gt; to transform Git commits into a shared story for a repository.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, the single-track nature of the conference is one of its best qualities. Because only one presentation is being given at any time, conference attendees no longer feel pressured to choose between multiple interesting talks that occur during the same timeframe. Similarly, this prevents the rooms of popular talks/speakers filling up (which leads to sad conference attendees who really wanted to see the talk). I've also found it very intriguing because it provides exposure to new ideas I may not otherwise have sought out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Community&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I've found the single-track nature of the conference also helps to transform its conference attendees from mere participants into a community. Because it is likely a person has seen any given talk, it is very easy to begin a conversation with essentially anyone at the conference by asking them what they thought of the last speaker or presentation. It was very reassuring to have at least one ice breaker to discuss with others. During the course of that discussion, further talkings points could generally be gleamed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The conference also facilitated these discussions by having 30 minute "hallway tracks" between talks. I found this was a good amount of time in which to meet other members of the community and to reflect on the previous talk. Although I recognize it is always possible to skip presentations at other conferences, I like how Steel City Ruby Conf forced a long hallway track to facilitate discussion among its community as well as reassure the members that they need not spend every moment at a conference listening to the presenters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, the long (two hour) lunch period was fantastic. The conference itself did not provide lunch but instead encouraged its participants to venture into the city in groups to find both wonderful food and conversation. The &lt;a href="http://www.neighborsinthestrip.com/"&gt;Strip District&lt;/a&gt; -- the neighborhood of Pittsburgh in which the conference is held -- has a plethora of amazing restaurants serving a large variety of cuisine. In addition, the long lunch also provided ample time to explore the city with other conference attendees.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;You should probably go in the future&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, this conference was fantastic and I look forward to attending it again next year. If you're considering attending in the future, I would highly recommend you do. Feel free to &lt;a href="/humans.txt"&gt;contact me&lt;/a&gt; if you have any questions about my experiences at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="conferences"></category><category term="ruby"></category><category term="scrc"></category></entry><entry><title>Pelican-Gist-Comments Plugin</title><link href="http://magically.us/2013-07-31/pelican-gist-comments-plugin.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-31T09:05:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kevin Richardson</name></author><id>tag:magically.us,2013-07-31:2013-07-31/pelican-gist-comments-plugin.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;The other day I created &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/pelican-gist-comments"&gt;Pelican-Gist-Comments&lt;/a&gt;, a plugin for &lt;a href="http://getpelican.com"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; that allows a Pelican site owner to utilize Gists as a comment engine for his blog posts. Essentially, a Gist will be created for an article (based on its slug) whenever it is rendered into HTML by Pelican. The ID of the Gist will then be stored in &lt;code&gt;gist_comment_ids.json&lt;/code&gt; and added to the article's metadata as 'gist_id'. Afterwards, the ID can be accessed in a template via &lt;code&gt;{{ article.gist_id }}&lt;/code&gt;. For more information, see &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/pelican-foundation/blob/master/templates/article.html#L19"&gt;this example template&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the notion behind this plugin is not without its faults. At this time, &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/maxogden/3422419"&gt;Gists do not notify their owner&lt;/a&gt; whenever a user posts a comment. However, it may be possible to circumvent this limitation by writing a small program that occasionally checks the comments on your Gists and alerts you when their numbers change. In addition, the user must have a GitHub account to post a comment (but I suppose this may help reduce spam).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don't believe Pelican-Gist-Comments is a finished product by any means but it was a very fun plugin to hack together. Nonetheless, I hope you find it useful. If you have any thoughts or suggestions, please submit &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/pelican-gist-comments/issues"&gt;an issue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/pelican-gist-comments/pulls"&gt;pull request&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="meta"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="writing"></category><category term="python"></category></entry><entry><title>Thoughts on PyOhio 2013</title><link href="http://magically.us/2013-07-29/thoughts-on-pyohio-2013.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-29T07:31:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kevin Richardson</name></author><id>tag:magically.us,2013-07-29:2013-07-29/thoughts-on-pyohio-2013.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Over this past weekend, I traveled to Columbus, Ohio with &lt;a href="http://anne.magically.us"&gt;a friend&lt;/a&gt; to attend &lt;a href="http://pyohio.org"&gt;PyOhio&lt;/a&gt;. This free Python conference was an incredibly enjoyable experience; thus, I certainly look forward to attending it again in the future. If you're wondering whether or not you should attend PyOhio, I would certainly offer my recommendation as it was very satisfying and Columbus seems like a nice host city.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The conference&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PyOhio's attendees had a very wide blend of experience levels and I believe the conference organizers chose talks with difficulty levels appropriate to the diverse audience. For instance, while I had opportunities to learn about &lt;a href="http://pyohio.org/schedule/presentation/37/"&gt;how one man uses Mock&lt;/a&gt;, my friend (who is more of a notive programmer) greatly enjoyed &lt;a href="http://pyohio.org/schedule/presentation/39/"&gt;building a simple game in Python&lt;/a&gt;. It was furthermore enlightening to learn about the plethora of areas in which people are using Python to solve interesting problems. For instance, although I'm currently focusing mostly on web development, others use Python to perform &lt;a href="http://pyohio.org/schedule/presentation/31/"&gt;network analysis&lt;/a&gt; to gain an understanding of the communities that exist on social networks like Twitter or &lt;a href="http://pyohio.org/schedule/presentation/28/"&gt;perform arbitrage on Amazon&lt;/a&gt; to pay for Christmas gifts. Moreover, the attendees of the conference were friendly and open to discussing many topics, including their work, their hobbies, etc. As with all conferences, it was refreshing to gain an appreciation for the kinds of work one may not think about during his day-to-day life and to network with a wide variety of intriguing individuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The location&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found both Ohio State University and Columbus to be beautiful places. Furthermore, they were laid out sensible enough so as to not be difficult in which to navigate. Food in the area was delicious and not too expensive. In that regard, I would highly recommend a trip to &lt;a href="http://www.hdrestaurants.com/brazenhead/5thavenue/"&gt;Brazenhead&lt;/a&gt;, a phenomenal pub with great burgers. Furthermore, the street on which the conference is located hosts a variety of restaurants that are good for both lunch as well as a relaxing dinner with newly-met friends. Although we didn't spend too much time exploring the city itself, we did get to see the &lt;a href="http://farm3.staticflickr.com/2732/4490289156_7102fc868f_o.jpg"&gt;the world's largest gavel&lt;/a&gt; as well as portion of a concert occurring on the other side of a river. Whenever I am next in Columbus, I would certainly like to further explore the city.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="conferences"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="pyohio"></category></entry><entry><title>Reflections on My Transition to a Startup</title><link href="http://magically.us/2013-07-22/reflections-on-my-transition-to-a-startup.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-22T19:34:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kevin Richardson</name></author><id>tag:magically.us,2013-07-22:2013-07-22/reflections-on-my-transition-to-a-startup.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;For approximately the past year, I worked as a web developer for a mid-sized company. Overall, the experience was pleasant. I got a chance to experiment with Django, JavaScript, and real-world web development; garner experience acquiring and completing the requirements of stakeholders; and meet some very intelligent and considerate people. However, I found myself feeling bored and constricted in the role as the needs of the company (at least in my position's capacity) were generally pretty low and undemanding. I could not wait until it was time to leave for the day and never felt terribly satisfied when I got home in the evening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thus, when the founder of a local startup emailed me to ask if I would be potentially interested in working with his company, I was highly intrigued and agreed to meet with him and his co-founder to discuss the role. After our quick lunch, he invited me to a follow-up interview at the startup's offices to go into more detail how I would propose fulfilling the technological needs of the new company. A few days later, he extended an offer which I later accepted. My work at the startup began on July 1st.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although I've not yet been an employee of the company for too long, I've wanted to reflect on my experiences for the benefit of myself as well as those considering employment in a startup. The experience has been very positive thus far and certainly differs from that of the mid-sized company. What follow are a (non-exhaustive) few of the differences I've noticed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Greater Transparency&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a world where various tiers of managers make decisions, it is often impossible to know the reasons behind various directives or the intended direction of the company. However, when a company is smaller, thoughts are often discussed by each employee before a decision is reached. Fortunately, I've been enjoying a sense of greater transparency in my company as each person is playing a pivotal role in its success. Instead of having managers whose schedules are entirely filled with meetings (and eventually discuss what needs to get done), I get to participate actively in the conversation of the product we are creating. This is very fun and refreshing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;More Responsibility&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, the chance for increased dialogue and action does not come without consequence. Each person has a very important role to play and, thus, seems to have more responsibility than he would at a larger company. Having more responsibility doesn't phase me, however, as I enjoy getting to make many of the integral technical decisions and have a fun time pondering over what those decisions should be. Although I was permitted to make a few decisions at my last job, it was much harder to make the larger decisions as they had already been made and were entrenched.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Fusion of Responsibilities&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Besides having to choose (and implement) the technical stack used by the company to bring its product to market, many other tasks need to be completed. Because the company is young (and still very small), each employee must be willing to help out whenever possible (even if it means listening to the plans of another and thinking through their strengths and weaknesses) and be willing to try things out of their comfort zones. I have found this is much more satisfying than doing the same thing each day and provides me a chance to learn and think about things I would not have otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article's intention is not to judge either type of company (or the ones at which I have worked in particular) as both have their merits and downfalls. Instead, I merely hope to shed light on issues I've encountered to hopefully guide someone contemplating employment at either type in the future. Regardless, do not forget these experiences are my own and it is highly unlikely yours would be identical.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="startups"></category><category term="employment"></category></entry><entry><title>Items of the Week: July 1, 2013</title><link href="http://magically.us/2013-07-07/iotw-july-1-2013.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-07-07T19:49:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kevin Richardson</name></author><id>tag:magically.us,2013-07-07:2013-07-07/iotw-july-1-2013.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;

Overall, I have been incredibly impressed with the CMS and look forward to using it more in the future. Because the CMS is an extension to Django and consequently offers all the benefits of the web framework, it is very easy to integrate various extensions. If a current &lt;a href="https://www.django-cms.org/en/add-ons/"&gt;add-on&lt;/a&gt; does not meet a requirement, it is possible to implement &lt;a href="http://docs.django-cms.org/en/2.4.0/extending_cms/custom_plugins.html"&gt;custom plugins&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As my current project moves forward, I need to create various plugins for the CMS that allow content managers to refer to various kinds of dynamic, database-driven content. To that end, I've decided to start with an easy project: a plugin for the creation and display of biographies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/cmsplugin-biography"&gt;cmsplugin-biography&lt;/a&gt; is a django CMS plugin that allows the user to create a biography of a person and refer to it within any number of pages. For example, a user may want to create biographies of his company's leadership team and refer to them across a variety of web pages. Instead of having to update a biography's text across multiple locations should something change, he will only need to update the biography once and the change will propagate across the pages on which the biography is located. Furthermore, each instance of the plugin allows the user to provide a "short description" that will override the global description attached to the selected biography. This is useful if, for instance, it is desirable to to provide a summary that links to another page containing the biography's full description.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Creating the plugin didn't take much time and I am relatively pleased with the results. As I begin integrating it into a CMS-powered site over the coming weeks, I'll hopefully determine what features it is missing. Eventually, I'll be comfortable enough with the plugin to release it on &lt;a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi"&gt;PyPI&lt;/a&gt;. If you use the plugin and run into any issues or would like a feature added, please leave a comment on the plugin's &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/cmsplugin-biography/issues"&gt;issues page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="python"></category><category term="django"></category><category term="django cms"></category></entry><entry><title>Items of the Week: May 20, 2013</title><link href="http://magically.us/2013-05-26/iotw-may-20-2013.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-05-26T13:39:00-04:00</updated><author><name>Kevin Richardson</name></author><id>tag:magically.us,2013-05-26:2013-05-26/iotw-may-20-2013.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.django-cms.org"&gt;Django CMS&lt;/a&gt; -- My group has been tasked with conjoining my company's plethora of websites under a single, CMS-powered website to reduce confusion among customers and unify the company's branding presence. As many of the sites currently use the fantastic &lt;a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; framework and the team greatly enjoys using it, we wanted to find an extension to the framework that would fit the needs of the project. To that end, Django CMS seems to fit the bill incredibly well. If interested, I suggest you &lt;a href="https://demo.django-cms.org/"&gt;try out Django CMS's demo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

As mentioned on the app's website, "Over the course of an eight week, 25 workout training [program], you’re trained to help collect supplies and protect the town from the encroaching zombie apocalypse." The application syncs to Zombielink, a web app allowing you to view a plethora of information about your sessions, including distance covered, time ellapsed, and a map of the the route you've taken.&lt;/li&gt;

It's very useful because, among other reasons, it lets the user create an environment that will be totally isolated from others. Vagrant-vbguest is a plugin for Vagrant which "automatically installs the host's VirtualBox Guest Additions on the guest system" upon boot of the VM. It's very useful because issues may arise if the Guest Additions versions do not match across host and guest.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="maebert.github.io/jrnl/"&gt;Jrnl&lt;/a&gt; -- Jrnl is "[…] a simple journal application for your command line" written in Python that saves to text files and &lt;a href="http://dayoneapp.com/"&gt;Day One&lt;/a&gt; journals. According to the site, "a journal helps you to keep track of the things you get done and how you did them" and a good starting place is to make a habit of writing at least 20 words per day. I've been using &lt;a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/"&gt;nvALT&lt;/a&gt; to maintain my work journal over the past year but have found it sometimes inconveniencing to switch to the nvALT window when I want to compose. Because I spend a large majority of my time with a terminal as the focused window, I believe I'm going to see if jrnl works better. To setup jrnl with my Day One journal, I had to add the following to the journals object of my &lt;code&gt;.jrnl&lt;/code&gt; configuration file:  &lt;code&gt;"default": "/Users/kevin/Dropbox/Apps/Day One/Journal.dayone"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior"&gt;Taskwarrior&lt;/a&gt; -- Although &lt;a href="https://trello.com/"&gt;Trello&lt;/a&gt; is a wonderful tool I've been greatly appreciating for quite some time (especially to track work tasks in Kanban-like fashion), I often find myself wanting a much simpler list tool for my personal tasks and quick notes. From what I can tell based off my usage of it over the past week, Taskwarrior fulfills my requirements very well. Installation on OS X is very easy:  merely install &lt;a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/"&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;brew install task&lt;/code&gt;. For more information, check out its &lt;a href="http://taskwarrior.org/projects/taskwarrior/wiki/30-second_Tutorial"&gt;30-second tutorial&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thehikeguy.com/2011/11/10/pct-moleskines/"&gt;My Pacific Crest Trail Moleskine Journals&lt;/a&gt; -- In this blog entry from 2011, the author shares a multitude of image scans and stories from the journals he kept while hiking the &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Crest_Trail"&gt;Pacific Crest Trail&lt;/a&gt;. It's intriguing to see how the author's journals change over time as he learns what information he desires to track the most. I also appreciate how he shares his reasoning for keeping the journals:  "I would use my journal to define problems I would experience on the trail and come up with options for trying to solve the problem. […] Keeping a journal helps me define my main goal as well as daily goals I would make."&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://superherojs.com/"&gt;Superhero.js&lt;/a&gt; -- "[…] a continously updated list of articles that help explain the syntax of JavaScript, how to organize your projects, how to test your code, and what's on the horizon."&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Effective-JavaScript-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0321812182/"&gt;Effective JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; -- This book offers concise and digestible pieces of advice on JavaScript development.

Although the majority of items will likely be websites (as they are often the most easily accessible kind of items), I may mention books, applications, video games, or anything else.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.trello.com/trello-for-ipad-is-here/"&gt;Trello for iPad is Here!&lt;/a&gt; -- The incredibly useful board- and list-based information management tool now has an iPad application. It looks fantastic but has a few oddities on iPad mini (such as a card's edit description field appearing below the on-screen keyboard).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://davidseah.com/blog/2012/08/trello-again-followup/"&gt;Trello Again:  Followup&lt;/a&gt; -- An examination of &lt;a href="http://davidseah.com/"&gt;David Seah&lt;/a&gt;'s personal Trello workflow. He seems to advocate keeping all personal items on one board so as to not lose track of items spanning multiple boards. Furthermore, I enjoy his idea of prepending unplanned items with a "+" sign.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.thoughtbot.com/"&gt;Thoughtbot&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/product-management/trello"&gt;Process management with Trello guide&lt;/a&gt; -- Over the past four months, I've been trying to revamp my team's (essentially non-existent) style of project management to something resembling [Kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_(development) because we serve in an operational role and work on many projects simulataneously. Originally, we followed &lt;a href="https://community.uservoice.com/blog/trello-google-docs-product-management/"&gt;the Trello workflow used by Uservoice&lt;/a&gt; and found it generally worked well. However, I've felt it lacked a good place to note technical improvements/refactorings that had to be made (such as upgrading a site from Django 1.3 to 1.4) as well as a good review process. Thoughtbot's guide to its Trello workflow solves many of the issues I've had with my team's current Trello implementation and seems like it will work much better for my team's structure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://blog.fogcreek.com/the-trello-tech-stack/"&gt;The Trello Tech Stack&lt;/a&gt; -- Brett Kiefer describes the front-end and back-end technologies used to create Trello.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://omniti.com/seeds/your-code-may-be-elegant"&gt;Your Code May Be Elegant&lt;/a&gt;
 -- "Your code may be elegant, but if it doesn't meet the objectives (be they time or business) it doesn't f***ing work." Although it is interesting and exciting to build the most robust solution possible, it is more important to consider the business contraints of time and money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://timepiece.inostudio.de/"&gt;Timepiece Rounded&lt;/a&gt; -- An OpenType-font which displays time strings (like 17:23:25) as a clock glyph. Fonts can define &lt;a href="http://alistapart.com/article/the-era-of-symbol-fonts"&gt;custom ligatures&lt;/a&gt;, a sequence of characters, that are replaced with a single glyph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://java.ociweb.com/mark/clojure/article.html"&gt;Clojure - Functional Programming for the JVM&lt;/a&gt; -- "[…] a fairly comprehensive introduction to the Clojure programming language."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.one-tab.com/"&gt;OneTab&lt;/a&gt; -- A neat Chrome extension that converts all your tabs to a list within a page (and then back again).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://mediaqueri.es"&gt;Media Queries&lt;/a&gt; -- "A collection of inspirational websites using media queries and responsive web design." &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://craphound.com/ftw/"&gt;For the Win&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://craphound.com/"&gt;Cory Doctorow&lt;/a&gt; -- A novel in which gold farmers struggle to bring better working conditions to themselves and all workers around the world.

&lt;p&gt;As stated in &lt;a href="http://magically.us/2013-01-01/hello-world.html"&gt;my "Hello World" post&lt;/a&gt;, magically.us is created with &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; &amp;mdash; a static website generator &amp;mdash; and hosted on &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub Pages&lt;/a&gt;. Benefits of static websites are abundant. This combination allows one to easily update the look and feel of a website as well as its content while maintaining a complete revision history through the &lt;a href="http://git-scm.com/"&gt;Git version control system&lt;/a&gt;. Static websites are awesome because they allow one to maintain a copy of her content and not worry about the "walled garden" effects of sites like Facebook wherein content can be challenging to export to other platforms. Generators are incredibly useful because they allow one to separate her content from her presentation templates. Because static websites are HTML and related assets, it is incredibly easy to move one's site to other webhosts as is necessary or desired. Another nicety exists in that GitHub Pages also provides the URI &lt;code&gt;http://username.github.com&lt;/code&gt; and optionally allows the user to use her own domain. Static website generators (like Pelican) generally allow one to write content in lightweight markup languages (like &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText"&gt;reStructuredText&lt;/a&gt;) that is translated to HTML as necessary.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This post introduces how I maintain this website and (hopefully) provides the reader a starting place for her own experimentations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Assumptions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You're using a Unix-like environment and are comfortable using a command-line terminal and shell. If you're using Windows, you may want to examine my &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/python-web-dev-box"&gt;python web-dev box&lt;/a&gt;, a &lt;a href="http://vagrantup.com"&gt;Vagrant&lt;/a&gt; virtual machine, to provide this environment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have Python, &lt;a href="http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/"&gt;virtualenv&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.doughellmann.com/projects/virtualenvwrapper/"&gt;virtualenvwrapper&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip"&gt;pip&lt;/a&gt; installed on your machine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You have installed Git and have created a &lt;a href="http://github.com"&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt; account. I furthermore assume you have working knowledge of Git. &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/"&gt;GitHub's help pages&lt;/a&gt; may prove useful for many questions you may have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Setup&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/kfr2.github.com/fork"&gt;Fork my kfr2.github.com repository&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Underneath the repository's settings, rename the forked repository to &lt;code&gt;your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Open a terminal.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Clone the repository to your machine with the command &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/your_username/your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make a new virtualenv for the project by running &lt;code&gt;mkvirtualenv your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;cd your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;setvirtualenvproject&lt;/code&gt; to established &lt;code&gt;your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt; as the virtualenv's default directory. When you next run &lt;code&gt;workon your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt; to load the virtualenv, your shell will change its working directory to the &lt;code&gt;your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt; directory.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;git checkout source&lt;/code&gt; to see the site's source files (rather than its compiled HTML files).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install the project's requirements:  &lt;code&gt;pip install -r requirements.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;mkdir themes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Download &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes"&gt;a Pelican theme&lt;/a&gt; and place it within a subdirectory of &lt;code&gt;themes&lt;/code&gt;. For instance, you can download &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/pelican-svbtle"&gt;my site's theme&lt;/a&gt; via &lt;code&gt;git clone https://github.com/kfr2/pelican-svbtle.git your_username.github.com/themes/pelican-svbtle&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update the settings within &lt;code&gt;pelicanconf.py&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;publishconf.py&lt;/code&gt;. You may find Pelican's &lt;a href="http://docs.getpelican.com/en/3.1.1/settings.html"&gt;settings documentation&lt;/a&gt; helpful.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Update content within &lt;code&gt;content&lt;/code&gt;'s subdirectories. For instance, you will likely want to delete any entries underneath &lt;code&gt;content/blog&lt;/code&gt; as well as modify &lt;code&gt;content/extra&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;content/pages&lt;/code&gt; to your liking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you'd like to serve this site at something other than &lt;code&gt;your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt;, update &lt;code&gt;content/extra/CNAME&lt;/code&gt; to include the desired domain. See GitHub's "&lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-a-custom-domain-with-pages"&gt;Setting up a custom domain with Pages&lt;/a&gt;" for further instructions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you wish to run a development server to view your site and its changes, run the command &lt;code&gt;make devserver&lt;/code&gt;. The site should be accessible at &lt;a href="http://localhost:8000"&gt;http://localhost:8000&lt;/a&gt;. The development server can be stopped with the command &lt;code&gt;./develop_server.sh stop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When satisfied, commit your changes: &lt;code&gt;git commit -am "A description of your changes."&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push your source file changes: &lt;code&gt;git push origin source&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt; to push your compiled source files to GitHub. You will likely receive an email notification regarding your page's build status.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;General Workflow&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;workon your_username.github.com&lt;/code&gt; to activate the project's virtualenv.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;python new_post.py&lt;/code&gt; to create a new post.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit the post in your favorite text editor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Examine the post in context of your website with &lt;code&gt;make devserver&lt;/code&gt;. Shut the server down with &lt;code&gt;./develop_server.sh stop&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When satisfied with the post, run &lt;code&gt;git commit -am "Message describing the post"&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push the source changes with &lt;code&gt;git push origin source&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Push compiled files to your website with &lt;code&gt;make github&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Interesting Alternatives&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My suggested workflow may not suit your needs or interests. Indeed, throughout the course of writing this post I realized how tedious it may be to setup a website using the methods outlined above &amp;mdash; especially if one is unfamiliar with Git, GitHub, *nix, or Python. Thus, you may be interested in examining how the alternatives listed below fit your needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;GitHub Pages Automatic Page Generator&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GitHub allows one to &lt;a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-pages-with-the-automatic-generator"&gt;create pages with an automatic generator&lt;/a&gt; for both her user (at &lt;code&gt;http://username.github.com&lt;/code&gt;) and individual projects (at &lt;code&gt;http://username.github.com/project-name&lt;/code&gt;). This could be much less maintenance than a Pelican-based approach as GitHub hosts &lt;a href="https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll"&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;, the static website generator powering the automatic generator, and runs your site files through it when you push changes to the repository. In this situation, one will not need to have Python and the various Pelican dependencies installed. You may wish to view &lt;a href="http://magically.us/apg-test/"&gt;an example of Automatic Page Generator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;gist.io&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://gist.io"&gt;gist.io&lt;/a&gt; allows one to create posts via &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/"&gt;Gists&lt;/a&gt;, a GitHub feature that allows one to easily store snippets of code or text and change them over time. Gist.io's homepage describes how one may use it:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;1&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Create&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;on&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Github&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;with&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;one&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;or&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;more&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Markdown&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;syntax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;files&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
2&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;Note&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;the&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gist&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;It&lt;/span&gt;’&lt;span class="n"&gt;s&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;usually&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;longish&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;like&lt;/span&gt; 29388372&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
3&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;View&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;your&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;writing&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;presented&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;nicely&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;at&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;gist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gist&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;here&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;For reference, see the &lt;a href="http://gist.io/3135754"&gt;gist.io's example post&lt;/a&gt;. This method of content creation is incredibly rapid. However, it is designed for one-off posts as it does not currently provide a method for viewing multiple posts by the same author. If you like this style of content creation and wish gist.io acted more like a regular blog engine (as well as allowed you to customize its appearance), it may be worth forking &lt;a href="https://github.com/idan/gistio"&gt;gist.io's source&lt;/a&gt; into something that links to your gists and hosting it on a service like &lt;a href="http://heroku.com"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hopefully this article has enlightened you to how you may use a static website generator like Pelican to share your content with the world. No matter which generator you use to convert your writings to web pages, they will function similarly and should all serve to assist you in conveying your messages to the world. May your journeys be fruitful and intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="meta"></category><category term="github"></category><category term="blogging"></category></entry><entry><title>Hello World</title><link href="http://magically.us/2013-01-01/hello-world.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2013-01-01T19:55:00-05:00</updated><author><name>Kevin Richardson</name></author><id>tag:magically.us,2013-01-01:2013-01-01/hello-world.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;h3&gt;Prologue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good day to you, dear reader!  Welcome to magically.us, the personal website of &lt;a href="http://github.com/kfr2"&gt;Kevin Richardson&lt;/a&gt;, a software engineer and developer of web experiences.  Herein I will write about various things I find interesting as well as any revelations I have while developing different pieces of software or user experiences.  Although I currently work predominantly as a web developer (mostly with the lovely &lt;a href="http://djangoproject.com"&gt;Django&lt;/a&gt; framework), my personal and business work touches upon many facets and technologies.  Thus, my posts will not be strictly related to web development but may be very exploratory in nature.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The technology behind this site&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site is powered by &lt;a href="http://blog.getpelican.com/"&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; -- a static website generator  -- and is &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2/kfr2.github.com"&gt;hosted on GitHub&lt;/a&gt; using &lt;a href="http://pages.github.com/"&gt;GitHub pages&lt;/a&gt;.  Content is written in &lt;a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt;, a lightweight markup language that allows one to easily add syntax like headings, anchors, and lists to a page.  I use OSX and &lt;a href="http://mouapp.com/"&gt;Mou&lt;/a&gt;, the "missing Markdown editor for web developers", to develop and write the various content contained on this site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you desire your own personal site, I highly recommend a similar setup as the workflow for adding content to this site is quite easy if you are familiar with GitHub and Python.  If you're not (and desire to setup a similar website), fret not -- I will soon write a post describing how one can setup her own installation of Pelican with GitHub pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Epilogue&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you very much for perusing my small corner of the web.  If you already haven't, you may be interested in viewing &lt;a href="/pages/projects.html"&gt;a list of my projects&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://github.com/kfr2"&gt;my GitHub account&lt;/a&gt;.  Furthermore, please feel free to contact me using the methods listed in &lt;a href="/humans.txt"&gt;my humans.txt file&lt;/a&gt; as I would love to discuss Life, the Universe, and Everything with you.&lt;/p&gt;
